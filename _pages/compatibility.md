While Emu68 tries to stay as compatible as possible, bugs can happen.

If the bug you have found is related to Emu68 (CPU, performance etc.), feel free
to report it in the Issues section on Emu68’s GitHub page. If the problem is related 
to software running on AmigaOS side (Emu68 drivers, tools and utilities) then please
report it in the Issues section of the Emu68-tools GitHub page.

Before committing a report for your bug, have a look at the other open issues and 
if you find your issue there, feel free to comment and vote. If you are sure the 
issue is new, create a new entry. Please include all information you can think of that
might be relevant (PiStorm hardware version, Emu68 version, Amiga model) and steps 
necessary to reproduce the issue. A simple “it does not work” is usually not enough to
diagnose and fix the issue.
