While Emu68 tries to stay as compatible as possible, bugs happen.

If the bug you have found is related to Emu68 (CPU, performance etc.), feel free
to report it on Emu68’s GitHub page in Issues section. Is the problem related to
software running on AmigaOS side (Emu68 drivers, tools and utilities) then
please report it in Issues section of Emu68-tools.

Before commiting a report, have a look at other open issues. If you find your
issue there, feel free to comment and vote. If you are sure the issue is new,
create a new entry. Please include all information you can think of (PiStorm
hardware version, Emu68 version, Amiga model) and steps necessary to reproduce
the issue. A simple “does not work” is usually not enough.
