PiStorm is a hardware project designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of your Amiga.
It involves a RaspberryPi single board computer which replaces the
680x0 series CPU in your machine and provides a significant boost in performance.

The software side is handled by Emu68 which emulates the m68k processor (not any
specific model) and also provides access to the RaspberryPi hardware for AmigaOS drivers.
