PiStorm is a hardware project designed to enhance capabilities of your Amiga
significantly. It involves RaspberryPi single board computer which replaces the
680x0 series CPU of your machine providing a significant boost in performance.

Software side is handled by Emu68 which emulates m68k processor (not any
specific model) and provides access to RaspberryPi hardware for AmigaOS drivers.
